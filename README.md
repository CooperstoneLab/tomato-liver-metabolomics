# Background
Untargeted metabolomics and RNA seq code for analysis from Dzakovich et al. of livers of mice fed control, red, or tangerine tomato containing diets. Full paper is currently available as a [pre-print](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.18.536606v1) on bioRxiv.

**Scope:** Tomato consumption is associated with many health benefits including lowered risk for developing certain cancers. It is hypothesized that tomato phytochemicals are transported to the liver and other tissues where they alter gene expression in ways that lead to favorable health outcomes. However, the effects of tomato consumption on mammalian liver gene expression and chemical profile are not well defined.

**Methods and results:** We hypothesized that tomato consumption would alter mouse liver transcriptomes and metabolomes compared to a control diet. C57BL/6 mice (n=11-12/group) were fed a macronutrient matched diet containing either 10% red tomato, 10% tangerine tomato, or no tomato powder for 6 weeks after weaning. RNA-Seq followed by gene set enrichment analyses indicated that tomato type and consumption, in general, altered expression of phase I and II xenobiotic metabolism genes. Untargeted metabolomics experiments revealed distinct clustering between control and tomato fed animals. Nineteen molecular formulas (representing 75 chemical features) were identified or tentatively identified as steroidal alkaloids and isomers of their phase I and II metabolites; many of which are reported for the first time in mammals.

**Conclusion:** These data together suggest tomato consumption may impart benefits partly through enhancing detoxification potential.
